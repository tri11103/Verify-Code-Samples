A style guide helps to ensure that code is approachable and familiar to everybody on a team. The most important rule is that code should look as though it was typed by one person. *Any* agreed upon standard is better than no standard at all. That being said, the pages in this section offer up what has worked for us in the past. Nearly every rule has a logical reason behind it.

Style guides are available for:

1. [HTML](./html/)
2. [CSS](./css/)
2. [JS](./javascript/)

If you don't already have a style guide for your team, we recommend you adopt these rules. Teams work best when they're on the same page!
