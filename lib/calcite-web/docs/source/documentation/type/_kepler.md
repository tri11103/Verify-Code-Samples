[Kepler](http://www.fonts.com/font/adobe/kepler), designer by  Robert Slimbach, is used to add graphic interest to a page. For example, Kepler could be used for a large, stylized pull-quote on a marketing landing page. Kepler is the official secondary face of the Esri brand, and offers good counterpoint to both Avenir and Frutiger.
