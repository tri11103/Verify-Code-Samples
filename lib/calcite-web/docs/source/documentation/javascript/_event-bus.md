The event bus is used to help interactive patterns communicate with each other and the rest of your application.

Along with a set of common bus events, each pattern has a set of channels that it emits on and listens for. These events can be emitted or listened for by the larger application.

You can trigger or react to events by using the `on` and `emit` methods on the bus:

```
// assuming calcite-web.js is available as calcite

// do something when a drawer opens
calcite.bus.on('drawer:open', function (options) {
  console.log(options.id) // => "top-nav"
})

// open a drawer (must pass data-drawer name as "id")
calcite.bus.emit('drawer:open', {id: "top-nav"})
```
