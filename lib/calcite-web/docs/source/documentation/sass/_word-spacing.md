Word spacing is - well - the space between words.  The `word-spacing($n)` mixin accepts an integer, and applies letterspacing to the element as fractions of 1/1000 of an em. If you're familiar with word-spacing in design programs like Adobe InDesign, the `word-spacing` mixin will immidiately feel fairly natural.

While you can pass any integer to the mixin, below is a list of values you can pass to the `word-spacing` mixin to achieve well known typographic defaults:

| Value | Number               |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| em    | `word-spacing(1000)` |
| en    | `word-spacing(500)`  |
| thick | `word-spacing(333)`  |
| mid   | `word-spacing(250)`  |
| thin  | `word-spacing(200)`  |
| hair  | `word-spacing(166)`  |
