> Dropdowns rely on the `calcite-web.js` JavaScript library for their functionality. See the [JavaScript Documentation](../javascript/) for more information.

Dropdowns are good for showing multiple options under a single call to action. For example, if you had a download button, and you needed the user to choose a format for the download, you could put several choices in a dropdown.

Dropdowns differ from `select` elements in that they don't have a default state or a 'current' state. Instead, they offer a jumping off point for a series of related actions.

**Note:** Be sure to give the elements inside your dropdown the role of `menuitem` to ensure they're accessible to screen readers.
