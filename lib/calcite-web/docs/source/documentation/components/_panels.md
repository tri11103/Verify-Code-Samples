Panels are useful to draw attention or contain certain text on a page. They are simple containers, which can be used to help guide users through the visual hierarchy of your design.

_Note:_ be sure to use the [link modifier classes](../type/#link-color) to style links within a panel so that they pass WCAG 2.0 accessibility color contrast. For standard light-gray panels, use `link-dark-blue`.
