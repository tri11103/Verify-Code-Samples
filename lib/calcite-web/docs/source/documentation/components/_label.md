Labels are a way to call attention to a word. The `mark` element, a notification count, or an important indicator (like marking a technology as 'beta' or 'private') are all use cases for labels.

Labels should be limited to one or two words and should only be used in situations where the content in the label is quite important. Labels are sized in `em` units, so they will scale up with whatever element they are inside.
