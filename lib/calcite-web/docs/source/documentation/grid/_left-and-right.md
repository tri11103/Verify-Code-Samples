Use a class of `right` on html elements to float elements to the right. Use a class of `left` on html elements to float elements to the left.

Left and right classes also have additional responsive `tablet-` and `phone-` prefix classes. These allow you to float an element right on a large screen, but float it left when the screen is smaller.

For example, if you wanted an element to float right on desktop, but left on a phone, you could use responsive right and left classes to specify that:

```
<div class="right phone-left"></div>
```
