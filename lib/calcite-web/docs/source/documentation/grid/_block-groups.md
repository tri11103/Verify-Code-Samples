Block groups are designed for quickly creating gridded content, such as a tile pattern or image gallery. Block groups are percentage based, so they can subdivide columns. Block groups have the ability to break the regular grid system, and thus should be used sparingly and with thought.

<div class="block-group block-group-3-up">
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
</div>

```
<div class="block-group block-group-3-up">
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
  <div class="block"><div class="panel">Block</div></div>
</div>
```
