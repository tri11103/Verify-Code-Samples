The Calcite Grid System includes a full, responsive, and configurable grid with columns, a container, and a 'Block Group' grid. The main grid is different from standard CSS grid systems in two key ways:

1. Column widths are defined by the viewport size rather than percentage of their containers.
2. Built-in smart defaults for responsive sizing puts less columns across the screen at smaller sizes, rather than smaller columns.

These two principles mean that a column becomes a standard unit of measurement, creating a constant and abstracted grid system that stands behind the content of a page rather than within it.

### The Grid
