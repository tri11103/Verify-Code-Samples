Calcite Web includes a large set of helper classes to quickly layout a page. In addition to classes directly related to the grid like `column-X`, `pre-X` and `post-X` there are also classes which help space things vertically (`leader-X`, `trailer-X`, `padding-leader-X`, `padding-trailer-X`) and horizontally (`gutter-left-X`, `gutter-right-X`).

Certain other CSS properties that are commonly needed are available as well such as `show`, `hide`, `left`, `right`, and sticky classes.

Almost all of the helper classes are available with responsive prefixes as well. For example, `phone-leader-1` will set one line of space above the element on the mobile size only.
