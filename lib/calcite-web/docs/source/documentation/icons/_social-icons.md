A set of social icons are provided as part of calcite-web. Just use the `icon-social-X` class on an element. It is suggested you add an aria-label to help the visually impaired understand what the element with the icon represents as they won't be able to see the Facebook logo, for example:

```html
<span class="icon-social-facebook" aria-label="Facebook"></span>
```

Below are the current social icons. More sizes are planned. For now only 30x30 pixel square icons are available.
