Top navigation is the primary, header level navigation for a web site. It contains the root level pages, user logins, and the site title. The main navigation should be hidden on screen sizes smaller than the size of the navigation. This navigation should be moved to an off-screen drawer on the left hand side. Notice the separate `div` elements with `tablet-hide` and `tablet-show` classes in the sample below.
