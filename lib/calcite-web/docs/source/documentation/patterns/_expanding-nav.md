The exanding nav pattern is designed for use beneath the [Top Nav](top-nav) pattern. It can be used to create search, or the esri.com style Mega Nav Dropdown. Expanding navs are controlled by the `js-expanding-toggle` classes, which bind the javascript function to the element, and the `data-expanding-nav` attribute, which ties toggle controllers to specfific expanding navs.
