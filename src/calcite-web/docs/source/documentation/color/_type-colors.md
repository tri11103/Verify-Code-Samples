Three basic colors are set for color in typography. It's not recommended to change these values, but they are provided for your reference.

```scss
$type-color: $off-black;
$link-color: $blue;
$link-hover: $light-blue;
```

In writing Sass it's often easier to remember `$type-color` is the color of type than it is to remember the specific grayscale value that is the default for type.
